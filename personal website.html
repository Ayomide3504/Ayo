                    her fellow colleagues in the IT department. They advised him and counsled him on what to do to be a
                    computer guru(expert). As a result from he began to learn web development and was also taught Graphic Designs
                    by one of them. Awhana developed keen interest in the graphics designs and started practicing his designs
                    everyday. In the year 2022 he got his first job and from there has gotten several jobs from his remarkable skills.
